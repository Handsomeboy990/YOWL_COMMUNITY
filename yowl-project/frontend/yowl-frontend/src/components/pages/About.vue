    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      YOWL Community was created with a vision: to build a vibrant digital space where young individuals between <strong>13 and 35 years old</strong> can connect, share, and grow together.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      We understand the power of community-driven discussions. YOWL is more than a social platform—it is a safe environment where ideas, reviews, and personal experiences are exchanged freely and constructively.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg text-[#FF6B35] mt-6">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      To empower young people by providing a platform that fosters open discussions, peer-to-peer learning, and cultural exchange while ensuring safety and inclusivity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg text-[#FF6B35] mt-6">Why YOWL?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      - Because every voice matters.<br />
      - Because young people deserve a platform tailored to them.<br />
      - Because growth, learning, and fun can coexist in the same place.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      Whether you are here to share a review, discover new perspectives, or connect with like-minded individuals, YOWL Community is your space. Together, we create conversations that matter.
